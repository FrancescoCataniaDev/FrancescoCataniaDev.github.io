## __About me__
Hallo, I am Francesco Catania. Iâ€™m 22 years old and I live in Italy, Florence.
Currently I attend the Game Programming Course at TheSign Academy in Florence,  which I will end this year. 

I am a relieable, motivated and honest worker with good comunication skills and a great passion on video-games, which is the main reason because I decided to start this journey into Game Development.
