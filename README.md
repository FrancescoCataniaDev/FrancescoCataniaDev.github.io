## __About me__
Hallo, I am Francesco Catania. I’m 23 years old and I live in Tübingen, Germany.
I finished the the Game Programming Course at TheSign Academy in Florence. 

I am a reliable, motivated and honest worker with good comunication skills and a great passion for video-games, which is the main reason why I decided to start this journey into Game Development.

I started learning German and I‘m ready to learn new languages if it's required.

My favorite branch game of programming is Gameplay Programming, followed by Tools and UI.
